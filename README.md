Of course. Here is a comprehensive README.md file for your project. This file contains all the necessary information for someone to understand, set up, and run your application.

You can create a new file named README.md in your project folder and paste the content below into it.

Performance Management System
A simple, full-stack web application built to help managers set goals, track team performance, and provide continuous feedback. This tool provides a clear and interactive dashboard for both managers and employees.

‚ú® Features
Goal & Task Setting: Managers can create, view, and update goals for their team members. Employees can view their goals and log tasks against them for manager approval.

Progress Tracking: Both managers and employees can visualize the progress of each goal. Only managers have the authority to update a goal's status.

Continuous Feedback: Managers can provide written feedback on specific goals at any time. The system also includes a simple trigger for automated feedback notifications.

Performance Reporting: The system can generate a clear, historical view of an employee's performance, including past and present goals, tasks, and feedback.

Role-Based Views: The user interface dynamically changes based on whether the logged-in user is a manager or an employee.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: Python

Database: MySQL

Libraries: mysql-connector-python, pandas

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed:

Python 3.8+

MySQL Server (you can use MySQL Community Server, XAMPP, or another distribution)

Git

1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and clone the project repository:

Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Bash

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Create a file named requirements.txt in your project's root directory and add the following lines to it:

Plaintext

streamlit
mysql-connector-python
pandas
Now, install these dependencies using pip:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Database Setup
Start your MySQL server.

Open your MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench or a command-line tool).

Run the entire pms_system.sql script. This will create the pms_system database, all the required tables, and insert some sample data to get you started.

5. Configure Database Credentials
Open the backend.py file and update the database connection details with your MySQL username and password:

Python

# Inside backend.py, in the create_connection function:
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",      # <-- Replace with your MySQL username (e.g., "root")
    password="your_password",  # <-- Replace with your MySQL password
    database="pms_system"
)
‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application
Once you have completed the setup, run the following command in your terminal from the project's root directory:

Bash

streamlit run frontend.py
Your web browser should automatically open with the application running.
